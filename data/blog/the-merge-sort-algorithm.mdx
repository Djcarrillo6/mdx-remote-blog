# The Merge Sort Algorithm Challenge: Solved 2 Ways

### The History & Solution Design of Merge Sort
The `Merge Sort` algorithm was first conceived in the year 1948, by a brilliant mathematical computer scientist by the name of John von Neumann. This is a unqiue algorithm in the sense that is makes use of splitting, sorting, and finally merging. 

### Keys To Merge Sort 

#### Pre-Sorted Array Inputs
Merge sort exploits the fact that arrays of zero or one element are already sorted. For example, an array of just one element is by definition already sorted; same definition can apply to an array with zero elements in it as well. 

#### Divide & Conquer
Merge sort works by dividing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building them up to a newly sorted array.

#### How does it work?
```
The Splitting

Starting Array: [8, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 1, 2]

First Split: [8, 3, 5, 4]   [7, 6, 1, 2]

Second Split: [8, 3] [5, 4] [7, 6] [1, 2]

Third Split: [8] [3] [5] [4] [7] [6] [1] [2]
  - After this split, the elements can not be easily sorted back together


The Joining

[3, 8] [4, 5] [6, 7] [1, 2]

[3, 4, 5, 8]  [1, 2, 6, 7]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### Psuedo Code for Merging Sorted Arrays
- In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to first implement a helper function, which will be responsible for merging two sorted arrays.

- Given two arrays which are sorted, this helper function should return a new array which is also a sorted, and consists of all of the elements from the two input arrays. 

- This function should run in O(n + m)time and O(n + m)space and SHOULD NOT modify the parameters passed to it. 
  - - O(n + m) where 'n' & 'm' are the length of the two input arrays. They are usually a similiar length, if not the same length.  As either of the size of those arrays grows, so does the time needed to finish. 

### Psuedo Code for Helper Function: Merge()
- Create an empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input array.
- While there are still values we haven't looked at:
    - If the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array, push the value in the first array into our `results`(variable), and move on to the next value in the first array.
    - If the second value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, push te value in the second array into our `results`(variable), and move on to the next value in the second array.
    -  Once we exhuast one array, then we push in all remaining values from the other array.
    - Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty.
    - Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other arrays until you back at the full length of the array.
    - Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged (and sorted) array.

### Helper Function Merge()
#### The Javascript Code Implementation

```javascript:algorithms/mergeSort.js

function merge(arr1, arr2) {
	let results = [];
	let i = 0;
	let j = 0;

	while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
		if (arr2[j] > arr1[i]) {
			results.push(arr1[i]);
			i++;
		} else {
			results.push(arr2[j]);
			j++;
		};
	};
	// push remaining values if one array depletes before the other.
	while (i < arr1.length) {
		results.push(arr1[i]);
		i++;
	};
	// push remaining values if one array depletes before the other.
	while (j < arr2.length) {
		results.push(arr2[j]);
		j++;
	};
	return results;
};
```

### Psuedo Code for MergeSort()
- Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty, or have 1 element.
- Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array.
- Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged (and sorted!) array.

### Merge Sort Recursive()
#### Javascript Code Implementation
```javascript:algorithms/mergeSort-recursive.js

// Recrusive Merge Sort
function mergeSort(arr) {
	// Recursive base-case
	if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

	let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2); // find mid point
	let left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid)); // call mergersort on left
	let right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid)); // call mergesort on right
	return merge(left, right);
}
```


### Solution Code

```javascript:algorithms/mergeSort.js

function merge(arr1, arr2) {
	let results = [];
	let i = 0;
	let j = 0;

	while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
		if (arr2[j] > arr1[i]) {
			results.push(arr1[i]);
			i++;
		} else {
			results.push(arr2[j]);
			j++;
		};
	};
	// push remaining values if one array depletes before the other
	while (i < arr1.length) {
		results.push(arr1[i]);
		i++;
	};
	// push remaining values if one array depletes before the other
	while (j < arr2.length) {
		results.push(arr2[j]);
		j++;
	};
	return results;
};

// Recrusive Merge Sort
function mergeSort(arr) {
	// Recursive base-case
	if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

	let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2); // find mid point
	let left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid)); // call mergersort on left
	let right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid)); // call mergesort on right
	return merge(left, right);
}

// Test
// console.log(mergeSort([10, 24, 76, 73, 99, 111, 113, 112]));
```

### Big O of Merge Sort
- The best case, the average case, and the worst case for Merge Sort are all the same time complexity of `O(n log n)`. As  `n` grows with the length of the input array, the number of decompositions(splits until 1 element arrays) grows at the rate of `log n`; `O(n)` comaprisons are made, per decomposition.
